No	0	0	No	66.375	18.75	31.25	6	3	Inner hatch to PCM required a bit of finesse to function properly. I'm not sure how well that would work in a contingency situation if the crew was under duress.	5	6	It seemed like there was plenty of space for us to move around, even in 1 g.	6	6	6	6	6	6	6	6	6	5	6	Acceptable as is	Seems like plenty of space to me. Much more space than I'm accustomed to with camping. Only gripe would be location of personal trash bag in sleeping quarters is close to sleeping bag. 	6	6	6	6	5	6	6	5	6	6		Collapsed	It may be a little cramped for 4 people in 1 g but seems like it would be perfectly fine for zero g. Only complaint is location of food storage may be a bit cumbersome to reach in zero g after you've gathered around the expanded table.	6	6	6	6	6		Everything seemed to be completely acceptable.	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	6	6	6	3	6	6	The air ducting through the hatch was poorly placed during the contingency.	6	6	5	6	6	6		The treadmill was a bit too close to the front wall during exercise.	6	6	6	6	6	6	6	Perfectly accetpable	6	6	6	6	4	6	Having the tools stored behind me during the science tasks was a bit cumbersome but not too badly.	2	5	4	3	3	Yes	Having the air ducting in the escape path is very cumbersome. With training, the risk of the hatch design could be eliminated. I understand the mechanism of the hatch is simulated but the movement of the hatch was very clunky and slowed us down. I think it would be more realistic to have test crews train on emergency procedures before having them execute the procedures in a simulated contingency.	5	5	1	5		5	4	5	5	5	5	Intravehicular assistant								5	5	5		5	4	I don't think spatial dividers would add anything to the habitat layout.

But on a long duration mission I could see them as very important to overall crew happiness.	5		Airlock, Emergency Path	Make the emergency path more free flowing (remove ducting from emergency path. Add more volume for the airlock.		Yes	No	1		No	4	6	6	Yes	Yes	HAB forward (to airlock)			Improve the way you call out emergency procedures in the manual and make sure crew members are aware of where emergency life support items are located.	The airlock seemed very small with two crewmembers inside it with EVA suits on. I still don't like the ducting being passed through the hatches.	5	6	No	Yes	Yes	HAB aft (to PCM), HAB forward (to airlock)	HAB aft (to PCM)	Operated two or fewer hatches	USA	USA	English, Russian, Portuguese
